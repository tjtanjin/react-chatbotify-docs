</p>

React ChatBotify Docs is the user guide for the [React ChatBotify library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chatbotify). The guide itself is built on Docusaurus and this repository contains the code for generating the site.

The goal of React ChatBotify Docs is to provide users with ease of access to the information for using the React ChatBotify library. To achieve this, a great deal of effort has gone into curating the user guide and a sharing can be found at this [article](https://tjtanjin.medium.com/beyond-the-code-reflections-on-crafting-an-effective-user-guide-0480d8af0cd9).

Note that this repository contains the code for the user guide. If you're looking for the repository for the React ChatBotify library itself, you may [look here](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify).

### Features

React ChatBotify Docs offer the following notable features:

- **Quickstart:** In as simple as 3 steps, you can get your own chatbot up and running.
- **Playground:** Before even committing to use the library, a playground is available for you to test waters.
- **Search:** Backed by Algolia's search engine, you can easily look up the user guide for specific information.
- **Live Examples:** A slew of examples curated to fit common use cases are present, complete with live editors for experimentation.
